## Performance Analysis Summary

This evaluation demonstrates the model's strong performance across all three recognition tasks. The gender recognition model achieved the highest accuracy at 90.00%, followed by age and expression recognition models at 85.00% and 85.00% respectively. The high F1 scores across all models indicate good balance between precision and recall, suggesting the models are effective at both identifying positive cases and avoiding false classifications.

The models were evaluated on a test set of 20 carefully selected images representing various age groups, genders, and facial expressions. The results provide a reliable indication of the model's performance in real-world applications.
